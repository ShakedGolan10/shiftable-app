*** Regarding userContext: Its checking only on refresh if the user is signed in and accordingly redirect the window to login page f not
    but, I also have middleware that checks in every api call if the user is logged in, so... 

*** When need to view the shifts use this: shifts/[id]/index.page.tsx because than I could make the page ssr,
    and fetch the shifts based on Id in the query url also use loading.tsx, and fetch the data at the component.
